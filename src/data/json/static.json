So, here it is, my self-curated study plan of Diploma in Software Engineering! I have no concrete grading policy set in place but I do require myself to read at least 1 book per course. Of course, I also will be doing practical assignments that go alongside the books and will most probably post them here as well. We'll see how much time it will take me to complete the whole thing. :)"
